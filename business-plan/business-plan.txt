- Ad revenue for empty leases (partner with local student housing options/landlords to help get their ads to people in need)
    - Per estimate of credits to referals, 250$ over the year would come out to around 20$ a month.
    - Charging 10-20$ a unit seems reasonable

Marketing and Sales
- Tik tok -> "tell me your craziest roommate stories" interviews
- Outreach to friends
- Outreach through the university?
- Provides a safe and trustworthy site

Funding Request
- Costs are most likely
    - Website domain

    - bucket for data
    - hosting servers
    - copyright Costs
    - legal costs

Financial Projections
- tbd (need to figure out how much to charge for ads, basically a free service right now)
- 10-20$ per empty unit at 2.8% vacancy rate with 76,000 houses would be MAX 21,280$ a month at 10$ or 42,560$ at 20$
- (that would just be max for madison wi)
- future goals (5 years) of 5 large sized campuses -> MAX 106,400$-212,800$ a month
